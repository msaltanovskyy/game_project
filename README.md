Overview
This repository contains a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic game of Battleship, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Perfect for learning the basics of game development and web design, this project demonstrates how to create an interactive board game where players battle against an AI opponent.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Play against a computer opponent with a user-friendly interface.
Responsive Design: The game is styled to be visually appealing and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
Turn-based Mechanics: Enjoy turn-based gameplay with a smooth transition between player and computer turns.
Game Restart: Restart the game with a simple button click to try different strategies or play again.
How It Works
Player Board: Displays the player's grid where ships are placed and attacks are made.
Computer Board: Displays the computer's grid where the player attempts to sink hidden ships.
Ship Placement: Ships are randomly placed on the board, and both player and computer have their own ships.
Gameplay Mechanics: Players click on cells to attack, and the game automatically handles the computer's response.
Game Status: Real-time feedback is provided to indicate whose turn it is and whether the game is over.
